# Python Exercises

This project comprises of 12 Exercise which starts from understanding the basics of Python to creating a Project in the last exercise. With this Project as a base, complex programs can be created without the need of revisiting the script structures or its anatomy. 

## Exercises

- Excercise 1
This excercise includes the Assignments and Variables, its data types, operators and coding with Strings.
- Excercise 2
Documentation plays a vital role is coding, this section will help describe the use and functionality of the code which also includes Headers, Comments, Docstrings, etc.
- Excercise 3
In this section, Data Structures of Python like Lists, Tuples, Disctionaries and Sets will be covered.

- Excercise 8
Python also uses Object Oriented concepts and its practice will be covered in this section.
- Excercise 9
